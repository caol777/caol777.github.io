## Intro

SadServers is a platform for SRE/DevOps engineers to practice their troubleshooting skills. Here are my write-ups for the challenges.

## Saint John

I started with Saint John. The issue was a web server not responding.

```bash
curl localhost:80
```

It turns out the process wasn't running.

## Santiago

Santiago involved checking logs.

> "Check the logs, always check the logs."

## Saskatoon

Saskatoon was about disk space.

## Tokyo

Debugging a slow python script.

## Manhattan

Manhattan required fixing a Docker container.

## Capetown

Network latency issues.

## Salta

Process limits.

## Jakarta

Java memory leaks.

## Bern

Service configuration.

## Singara

Database connection issues.

## Karakorum

Load balancing.

## Oaxaca

Oaxaca was a tricky permissions issue.

## Venice

SSL certificate expiry.

## Melbourne

DNS resolution problems.

## Hong-Kong

Latency again? No, packet loss.

## Lisbon

The final challenge I attempted today.
