**About the Blog:**This is my hub for write-ups on cybersecurity competitions, events, and projects. I hope my insights can help others learn along with me.

**About Me:** Hey, I'm Shaamad. I am an MIS major passionate about Cybersecurity and IT Infrastructure. Currently, I serve as the Vice President of my school's cybersecurity club, where I act as a Linux instructor, competition advisor, and overall jack-of-all-trades.

Right now, I am spearheading the build of our Proxmox server to host a custom virtual infrastructure for learning Penetration Testing, Cyber Defense, and SOC operations. I love Linux (specifically Debian), physical music media (vinyl/CDs), and all things technology.

Outside of school, I am active in the local community, engaging with organizations like the South Florida Information Systems Security Association (SFISSA), the Boca Raton 2600 Chapter, and Hack Miami.
